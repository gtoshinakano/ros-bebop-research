## 『What is your motivation to study at a University in Japan?』

This was one of the questions I had to answer on the application form for my scholarship to Japan. In a space of about 30 lines I had to write, in Japanese, the reason for applying for that opportunity.

I was always creative and loved to create my inventions, which always resulted in something more or less useful and a good mess to fix later...

I have built things like an earthworm farm to decompose food scraps for producing organic fertilizer and an irrigation system based on silicone hoses and perforated pens.

All because of an **uncontrollable desire to create something with my own hands**. 

Perhaps this was one of the reasons for choosing to become a programmer. As a programmer I could freely create my apps, websites or whatever it was that I wanted to create.

My journey through programming studies led me to WEB development. Which is, simply put, the technology for creating websites.

For that, I had to learn *frontend* - the visual part of the site, *backend* - the "brain" of the site and *databases* - the memory of the site. Since then, I have followed the evolution of Web technologies and Internet applications.

So I'm an old school guy (not so old). But a guy who knew *Netscape* and already tested a ```html``` file with ```javascript``` on it. A lot of people won't understand what I'm talking about.

Today everything is different on the Internet, we have streaming and video lives, GPS applications on mobile phones, something called *Cloud Computing* that nobody needs to know how it works to be able to use it.

**Technology has evolved unimaginably.**

Therefore, I wandered: **What would be interesting for me to study in Japan?**

I thought to myself: In Japan technology is widely used, as there are many machines to buy drinks everywhere, automatic doors, heated toilet seats and a jet of water to wash after the big one...

And I asked myself again: **What should a Japanese guy that looks like me want to study?**

I thought of robots and *anime*. And, of these two things, what would complement my knowledge very well would be studying something related to robotics.

I've been working with Internet development since I graduated from college, so from that part I understand something. On the other hand, I don't know anything about robotics. Things like, for example, connecting a machine to the PC and programming it to do something.

And just now with the advent of the 5G internet, the rising technology concept from now on is the Internet of Things - the IOT. The concept that basically consists of connecting objects of everyday life on the internet with the purpose of making them more useful and smarter.

In other words, studying development for IOT is, roughly speaking, combining the technologies that I studied so far with the technologies that the Japanese guy that looks like me would like to study.

And I thank God that I met Professor Kikuchi and managed to make this exchange at Hokkai gakuen University, in Hokkaido. The professor introduced me to the tool that allows me to combine what I know with robotics to be able to develop applications for IOT.

I learned everything in a practical way, working on a project with the goal of controlling a drone by this tool with the possibility of connecting to the internet in the future.

And, precisely because of the lack of materials on this subject in the Portuguese language, I feel that it's my duty to publish this knowledge to contribute with this area to my country.

So, if you want to know one of the ways for developing for IOT, I invite you to enjoy all the content on this website.

I hope this material finds people interested in the subject. And that this material would be useful for more projects of this nature to flourish in my country.

Cheers.
