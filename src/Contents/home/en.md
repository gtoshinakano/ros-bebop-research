## Note from the Author

![Image of Da Vinci](static/images/da-vinci-fly.jpg '{"style":{"float":"right","maxWidth" :"40%"},"hidden":"mobile","description": "Da Vinci\'s \\"Helicopter\\" draft"}')

Leonardo da Vinci was a talented artist in his time. 

Few know that, only after the age of 30, he began to dedicate himself to the studies of mathematics and engineering. 

Since then, his works have come to have an unimaginable breadth of area, gender, and purpose, which has made him recognized worldwide for his contribution to technological advances in the areas of optical, hydraulic, and civil engineering.

EI am not a genius, much less a talented artist like Leonardo da Vinci.

__I am a Programmer__. 

My inspiration in Da Vinci and other personalities like Thomas Edison, Steve Jobs and Bill Gates made me follow the path of creativity and constant learning.

This opportunity to study at a University in another country came out from a desire to learn about new technologies and from the connection with people who encouraged me to explore new horizons.

In early 2020, in the midst of the new coronavirus pandemic, unfortunately, my country was unable to take the best actions to prevent the spread of infections.

Thanks to that, for a long time we were the second country with the highest number of infections and these numbers have increased, day after day.

I remember watching on TV news, a video filmed by a drone used to alert people to stay inside their homes.

![Drone alerting people](https://j.gifs.com/2xLOY1.gif '{"style":{"maxWidth":"43%","float":"right"},"url":"https://imgflip.com/gif/4oqbao"}')

And that was when I realized that this could be the best time to study drone programming!

But the world was too insecure and unstable for me to run towards a dream...

Confused governments wanted to move the economy, airports were closed, many people were unable to return to their countries.

And the exchange that would normally begin in April, at the beginning of the Japanese school year, had to be postponed indefinitely.

And that was the worst period of uncertainty for me.

I had quit my job, bought clothes for a cold winter, Brazilian gifts and now I no longer knew when I was going or if I could even go.

Luckily I was in certain conditions that made it possible for me to enter Japan, so when the Japanese airports started working again, I was one of the first to be able to enter.

I arrived in Japan, made the quarantine for 14 days in Tokyo and, finally arrived in Hokkaido, where my research would take place.

So my research started 2 months late, however, the next 10 months were enough to be able to write this material and share it with you.

The experience at Hokkai Gakuen University Engineering Campus, in Sapporo - Hokkaido, made me a more skilled programmer and paved the way for new possibilities here or anywhere in the world.

Therefore, I feel that I must contribute by sharing this knowledge with you because I believe that the more knowledge we have, the greater our duty to share it to make the world better and better instructed.

I hope this material will be useful for you to learn a little about robotics, drones and IOT programming and that this piece of my story inspires you to become a better programmer, engineer or any other profession that makes sense to you.

I wrote it in order to make anyone understand this content because I had difficulty finding materials that were easy to understand. 

But do not use this material as the only source of knowledge as it will certainly not be enough.

This documentation is on [Github](https://github.com/gtoshinakano/ros-bebop-research). If you find something wrong or want to contribute with this content, send me an e-mail and I will be happy to talk to you!

## About the research proposal

At the end of 2019, I had the opportunity to study in Hokkaido, Japan, and the theme I chose to research was the development for Internet of Things - IOT.

IOT is, simply put, a concept that consists of connecting useful objects of everyday life on the internet, to make these objects even more useful and smart.. 

Like, for example, a coffee maker that can be controlled remotely over the internet to prepare coffee with a simple touch on the cellphone, learn from the user's habits and choose the best time to prepare the next delicious hot coffee..

And so on...

I had traveled to Japan a few times before and I always loved the way Japan used technology in its daily life.

**Robots are everywhere**

But I'm not talking about the robots you see in anime defeating enemies and saving Earth...

I'm talking about robots as small sensors in bathrooms, machines and/or huge and intelligent mechanical structures. They are everywhere in Japan.

In Brazil, these robots are used less frequently and the technology is usually imported from other countries, which makes the robotics market less developed than in other countries.

My curiosity as a programmer was to learn how it was possible to connect objects to the computer and, from there, read data and execute commands. My goal was to learn how to develop for IOT.

This is what I've learned and I will share it with you.

The professor responsible for my research, Kikuchi Yoshihito, introduced me to the perfect concept for learning about robot connectivity and controlling.

The goal for the research suggested by the professor was to create a web service to control a drone in order to simulate a delivery service system.

For that, I had to go through several stages of learning and challenges, until I was able to program to control the drone.

So I would like to say that the content that I present here is only intended to accomplish this main goal and I will be as detailed as possible so that you can successfully replicate my experiment.

Navigate the menu to start learning how to control a Bebop drone from your computer! **And it's all free**!!

## Sobre o Autor

Hello! My name is Gabriel Toshinori Nakano, Brazilian, 32 years old, Full Stack Web programmer.

Since I graduated from Technology in Systems Analysis and Development I've been working on Web solutions development with languages such as JAVA, PHP, SQL, HTML, CSS, Javascript and Typescript.

My current focus is to work with Javascript / Typescript as it is the language that allows us to develop a multitude of solutions.

Even this documentation was created from scratch using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) Framework!

I consider myself a creator and my creation is my code and its utilities.

But I also like subjects like Psychology, Philosophy, Marketing and Business.

I am passionate about knowledge and I always like to contribute to others in some way.

And I hope to contribute to you through this material!

Cheers!

## Agradecimentos pessoais

I'd like to say thank you to my family that encourages me since the beginning of my life and to my professor Kikuchi Yoshihito that has accept me at his lab and introduced me to the concepts that I present here.

I'm also very grateful to [HIECC - Hokkaido International Exchange and Cooperation Center](https://www.hiecc.or.jp/), the Hokkaido Government department that made this exchange possible even in the midst of pandemics, to [Hokkai Gakuen University](https://www.hgu.jp/) the University I attended during my entire stay in Japan.

Personally, I would like to thank Yuki Matsubara and Keiko Matsui, my HIECC friends, my brothers Hit and Massaki who were already in Japan and always welcome me with joy. 

And to everyone I met in Japan, お世話になりました、また会いましょう！
